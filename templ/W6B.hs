-- Week 6: Monads
--
-- Monads are a famously hard topic in learning Haskell. My advise is
-- to try different approaches to understanding monads while writing
-- as much code as possible. Merely contemplating various metaphors
-- for monads will not lead to understanding.
--
-- I recommend starting at these exercises only once you've read a bit
-- about monads. The two standard monads the exercises will use are
-- Maybe and State. Maybe is simple enough, but State requires some
-- looking at.
--
-- If you've yet to find a monad guide to your liking, try Learn You A
-- Haskell For Great Good. The monad chapter is here:
--
-- http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads
--
-- But you should probably browse through the previous chapter about
-- Functors too. The State monad is introduced a bit later:
--
-- http://learnyouahaskell.com/for-a-few-monads-more#state


-- Ex 1: let's use the Maybe type to talk about computations that can
-- fail. A value of type "a -> Maybe b" takes an argument of type a
-- and can either succesfully return a value of type b, or fail and
-- return Nothing.
--
-- Here is the operator ?> that defines the natural way of chaining
-- computations like this. We get the result of the previous
-- computation (Maybe a) and the next computation (a -> Maybe b) and
-- return the new result (Maybe b):

(?>) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
Nothing ?> _ = Nothing   -- In case of failure, propagate failure
Just x  ?> f = f x       -- In case of sucess, run the next computation

-- Your task is to help implement the function readName that given a
-- string like "Forename Surname" produces the pair ("Forname",
-- "Surname"). readName should fail (return Nothing) in the following
-- cases:
--
--   1. the input string doesn't contain a space
--   2. one of the names contains numbers
--   3. one of the names doesn't start with a capital letter
--
-- The function readNames has already been implemented using ?>. You
-- need to define the functions split, checkNumber and checkCapitals
-- so that readNames works correctly.

-- DO NOT touch this definition!
readNames :: String -> Maybe (String,String)
readNames s =
  split s
  ?>
  checkNumber
  ?>
  checkCapitals

-- split should split a string into two words. If the input doesn't
-- contain a space, Nothing should be returned
--
-- (NB! There are obviously other corner cases like the inputs " " and
-- "a b c", but you don't need to worry about those here)
split :: String -> Maybe (String,String)
#ifdef sol
split s = case break (==' ') s of (a,' ':b) -> Just (a,b)
                                  _         -> Nothing
#else
split s = undefined
#endif

-- checkNumber should take a pair of two strings and return then
-- unchanged if they don't contain numbers. Otherwise Nothing is
-- returned.
checkNumber :: (String, String) -> Maybe (String, String)
#ifdef sol
notNumber c = not $ elem c "0123456789"
checkNumber (for,sur) = if all notNumber for && all notNumber sur
                        then Just (for,sur)
                        else Nothing
#else
checkNumber (for,sur) = undefined
#endif

-- checkCapitals should take a pair of two strings and return them
-- unchanged if both start with a capital letter. Otherwise Nothing is
-- returned.
checkCapitals :: (String, String) -> Maybe (String, String)
#ifdef sol
checkCapitals (for,sur) = if isUpper (for!!0) && isUpper (sur!!0)
                          then Just (for,sur)
                          else Nothing
#else
checkCapitals (for,sur) = undefined

-- Ex 2: implement a function myTake that works just like take, but
--   1. the arguments are of types Maybe Int and Maybe [a]
--   2. if either of the arguments is Nothing, Nothing is returned
--   3. if the Int is larger than the length of the list, Nothing is returned
--
-- Use the Maybe monad, i.e. the >>= operator or do-notation.
--
-- DO NOT use pattern matching for Maybe.
--
-- Examples:
--  myTake (Just 2) (Just [5,6,7])
--    ==> Just [5,6]
--  myTake Nothing (Just [5,6,7])
--    ==> Nothing
--  myTake (Just 2) Nothing
--    ==> Nothing
--  myTake (Just 4) (Just [5,6,7])
--    ==> Nothing

-- Ex 3: given a list of indices and a list of values, return the sum

--
-- Use the Maybe monad, i.e. the >>= operator or do-notation.
--
-- DO NOT use pattern matching for Maybe.
--
-- Hint! implementa a function safeIndex :: [a] -> Int -> Maybe a
--
-- Examples:
--  selectSum [0..10] [4,6,9]
--    Just 19
--  selectSum [0..10] [4,6,9,20]
--    Nothing

-- Ex 4: below you'll find the implementation of a Logger monad and

--   B(0,k) = 0, when k>0
--   B(n,k) = B(n-1,k-1) + B(n-1,k)
--
-- Every call to the function should be logged as "B(n,k)".
-- Invocations should be logged in execution order.
--
-- Examples:
--   binom 0 0 ==> Logger ["B(0,0)"] 1
--   binom 0 7 ==> Logger ["B(0,7)"] 0
--   binom 1 1 ==> Logger ["B(0,0)","B(0,1)","B(1,1)"] 1
--   binom 2 2 ==> Logger ["B(0,0)","B(0,1)","B(1,1)","B(0,1)","B(0,2)","B(1,2)","B(2,2)"] 1

-- Ex 5: using the State monad, write the operation update that first

-- Ex 6: using the State monad, walk through a list and increment the
-- state by one each time a given element is encountered. Additionally
-- you should return the length of the list.
--
-- Do this by implementing a recursive State operation lengthAndCount.
-- Do not use the functions length or filter.
--
-- Example:
--  runState (lengthAndCount True [False,True,False,True,False]) 0
--    ==> (5,2)

-- Ex 7: using a state of type [(a,Int)] we can keep track of the

-- [('a',1),('x',3)] means that we've seen one 'a' and three 'x's.
--
-- Implement a State monad operation count that registers the

--
-- Examples:
--  runState (count True) []
--    ==> ((),[(True,1)])
--  runState (count 7) []
--    ==> ((),[(7,1)])
--  runState (count 'a') [('a',1),('b',3)]

-- Ex 9: implement the function ifM, that takes three monadic

--  runState (put 11 >> ifM test (return 'a') (return 'b')) 0

-- mapM (safeDiv 10.0) [1.0,0.0,2.0]  =>  Nothing
--
-- Your task is to implement the function mapM2 that works like mapM,

-- Examples:
--  mapM2 (\x y -> Just (x+y)) [1,2,3] [6,7]

--  runState (mapM2 (\x y -> if x then modify (+y) else return () ) [True,False,True] [1,2,4]) 0

-- Ex 11: Funnykiztan has cities that are named with by 0..n-1. Some
-- cities are connected by roads. Your task is to find out if you can
-- can get from city A to city B by following the roads.
--
-- The road network is given as an adjacency list, which means a list
-- of lists [[Int]] where the i'th list gives the cities to which city
-- i has a road to.
--
-- For example the road network:
--
-- 0--1
-- |\ |
-- | \|
-- 2--3
--
-- would be represented as:
--  [[1,2,3]
--  ,[0,3]
--  ,[0,3]
--  ,[0,1,2]]
--
-- Below you'll find the function routeExists that solves the task.
-- However a very important piece of the function, the helper function
-- dfs is still unimplemented.
--
-- The function dfs is intended to run a Depth-First Search. If you
-- don't know what this means, have a look in wikipedia.
--
-- Simply put, dfs uses roads to travel from city to city using roads,
-- using a state of type [Int] to keep track of which cities have been
-- visited. This is important because the road network will have
-- cycles.
--
-- Examples:
--   routeExists example1 0 2  ==> True
--   routeExists example2 0 2  ==> True
--   routeExists example2 3 5  ==> False
--   runState (dfs example2 0) []  ==> ((),[2,3,1,0])
-- When 1 and 2 have already been visited, dfs won't proceed to city 3:
--   runState (dfs example1 0) [1,2] ==> ((),[0,1,2])
--
-- A word on tests. The tests first test the function dfs in a couple
-- of simple situations. After this they test the function routeExists
-- more extensively. The tests look at the state produced by dfs but
-- do not care in which order it is.

-- Three cities, each connected to the two others
